Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to the faith of the choice ones of God, and an acknowledging of truth that `is' according to piety,
upon hope of life age-during, which God, who doth not lie, did promise before times of ages,
(and He manifested in proper times His word,) in preaching, which I was entrusted with, according to a charge of God our Saviour,
to Titus -- true child according to a common faith: Grace, kindness, peace, from God the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ our Saviour!
For this cause left I thee in Crete, that the things lacking thou mayest arrange, and mayest set down in every city elders, as I did appoint to thee;
if any one is blameless, of one wife a husband, having children stedfast, not under accusation of riotous living or insubordinate --
for it behoveth the overseer to be blameless, as God's steward, not self-pleased, nor irascible, not given to wine, not a striker, not given to filthy lucre;
but a lover of strangers, a lover of good men, sober-minded, righteous, kind, self-controlled,
holding -- according to the teaching -- to the stedfast word, that he may be able also to exhort in the sound teaching, and the gainsayers to convict;
for there are many both insubordinate, vain-talkers, and mind-deceivers -- especially they of the circumcision --
whose mouth it behoveth to stop, who whole households do overturn, teaching what things it behoveth not, for filthy lucre's sake.
A certain one of them, a prophet of their own, said -- `Cretans! always liars, evil beasts, lazy bellies!'
this testimony is true; for which cause convict them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
not giving heed to Jewish fables and commands of men, turning themselves away from the truth;
all things, indeed, `are' pure to the pure, and to the defiled and unstedfast `is' nothing pure, but of them defiled `are' even the mind and the conscience;
God they profess to know, and in the works they deny `Him', being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work disapproved.
And thou -- be speaking what doth become the sound teaching;
aged men to be temperate, grave, sober, sound in the faith, in the love, in the endurance;
aged women, in like manner, in deportment as doth become sacred persons, not false accusers, to much wine not enslaved, of good things teachers,
that they may make the young women sober-minded, to be lovers of `their' husbands, lovers of `their' children,
sober, pure, keepers of `their own' houses, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be evil spoken of.
The younger men, in like manner, be exhorting to be sober-minded;
concerning all things thyself showing a pattern of good works; in the teaching uncorruptedness, gravity, incorruptibility,
discourse sound, irreprehensible, that he who is of the contrary part may be ashamed, having nothing evil to say concerning you.
Servants -- to their own masters `are' to be subject, in all things to be well-pleasing, not gainsaying,
not purloining, but showing all good stedfastness, that the teaching of God our Saviour they may adorn in all things.
For the saving grace of God was manifested to all men,
teaching us, that denying the impiety and the worldly desires, soberly and righteously and piously we may live in the present age,
waiting for the blessed hope and manifestation of the glory of our great God and Saviour Jesus Christ,
who did give himself for us, that he might ransom us from all lawlessness, and might purify to himself a peculiar people, zealous of good works;
these things be speaking, and exhorting, and convicting, with all charge; let no one despise thee!
Remind them to be subject to principalities and authorities, to obey rule, unto every good work to be ready,
of no one to speak evil, not to be quarrelsome -- gentle, showing all meekness to all men,
for we were once -- also we -- thoughtless, disobedient, led astray, serving desires and pleasures manifold, in malice and envy living, odious -- hating one another;
and when the kindness and the love to men of God our Saviour did appear
(not by works that `are' in righteousness that we did but according to His kindness,) He did save us, through a bathing of regeneration, and a renewing of the Holy Spirit,
which He poured upon us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour,
that having been declared righteous by His grace, heirs we may become according to the hope of life age-during.
Stedfast `is' the word; and concerning these things I counsel thee to affirm fully, that they may be thoughtful, to be leading in good works -- who have believed God; these are the good and profitable things to men,
and foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions, and strivings about law, stand away from -- for they are unprofitable and vain.
A sectarian man, after a first and second admonition be rejecting,
having known that he hath been subverted who `is' such, and doth sin, being self-condemned.
When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent to come unto me to Nicopolis, for there to winter I have determined.
Zenas the lawyer and Apollos bring diligently on their way, that nothing to them may be lacking,
and let them learn -- ours also -- to be leading in good works to the necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.
Salute thee do all those with me; salute those loving us in faith; the grace `is' with you all!
