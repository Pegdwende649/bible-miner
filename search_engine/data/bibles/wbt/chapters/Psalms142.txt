\142:1\Maschil of David; a prayer when he was in the cave. I cried to the LORD with my voice; with my voice to the LORD I made my supplication.
\142:2\I poured out my complaint before him; I showed before him my trouble.
\142:3\When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my path. In the way in which I walked have they privily laid a snare for me.
\142:4\I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my soul.
\142:5\I cried to thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living.
\142:6\Attend to my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.
\142:7\Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the righteous shall encompass me; for thou wilt deal bountifully with me.
