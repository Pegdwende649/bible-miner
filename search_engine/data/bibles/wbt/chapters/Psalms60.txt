\60:1\To the chief Musician upon Shushan-eduth, Michtam of David, to teach; when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, when Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the valley of salt twelve thousand. O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.
\60:2\Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal its breaches; for it shaketh.
\60:3\Thou hast shown thy people hard things: thou hast made us to drink the wine of astonishment.
\60:4\Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may be displayed because of the truth. Selah.
\60:5\That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand, and hear me.
\60:6\God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide Shechem, and measure out the valley of Succoth.
\60:7\Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength of my head; Judah is my lawgiver;
\60:8\Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe: Philistia, triumph thou because of me.
\60:9\Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into Edom?
\60:10\Wilt thou not, O God, who hadst cast us off? and thou, O God, who didst not go out with our armies?
\60:11\Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.
\60:12\Through God we shall do valiantly: for he will tread down our enemies.
