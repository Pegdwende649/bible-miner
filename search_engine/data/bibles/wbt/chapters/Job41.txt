\41:10\None is so fierce that he dare rouse him: who then is able to stand before me?
\41:11\Who hath first benefited me, that I should repay him? whatever is under the whole heaven is mine.
\41:12\I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely proportion.
\41:13\Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to him with his double bridle?
\41:14\Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible around.
\41:15\His scales are his pride, shut together as with a close seal.
\41:16\One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.
\41:17\They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be sundered.
\41:18\His sneezings flash light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the morning.
\41:19\Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire dart forth.
\41:20\Out of his nostrils issueth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron.
\41:21\His breath kindleth coals, and a flame issueth from his mouth.
\41:22\In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him.
\41:23\The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; they cannot be moved.
\41:24\His heart is as firm as a stone; yes, as hard as a piece of the nether millstone.
\41:25\When he raiseth himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings they purify themselves.
\41:26\The sword of him that attacketh him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor the habergeon.
\41:27\He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.
\41:28\The arrow cannot make him flee: sling-stones are turned with him into stubble.
\41:29\Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear.
\41:30\Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the mire.
\41:31\He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of ointment.
\41:32\He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be hoary.
\41:33\Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.
\41:34\He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride.
