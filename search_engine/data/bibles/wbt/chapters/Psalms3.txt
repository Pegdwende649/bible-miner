\3:1\A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. LORD, how are they multiplied that trouble me? many are they that rise up against me.
\3:2\Many there are who say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah.
\3:3\But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
\3:4\I cried to the LORD with my voice, and he heard me from his holy hill. Selah.
\3:5\I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
\3:6\I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set themselves against me on all sides.
\3:7\Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all my enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
\3:8\Salvation belongeth to the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy people. Selah.
