\40:6\Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,
\40:7\Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and declare thou to me.
\40:8\Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me, that thou mayest be righteous?
\40:9\Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice like his?
\40:10\Deck thyself now with majesty and excellence; and array thyself with glory and beauty.
\40:11\Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that is proud, and abase him.
\40:12\Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread down the wicked in their place.
\40:13\Hide them in the dust together; bind their faces in secret.
\40:14\Then will I also confess to thee that thy own right hand can save thee.
\40:15\Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass as an ox.
\40:16\Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the navel of his belly.
\40:17\He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his male organs are wrapped together.
\40:18\His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like bars of iron.
\40:19\He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make his sword to approach him.
\40:20\Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the beasts of the field play.
\40:21\He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and fens.
\40:22\The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of the brook encompass him.
\40:23\Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.
\40:24\He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.
\41:1\Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou lettest down?
\41:2\Canst thou put a hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a thorn?
\41:3\Will he make many supplications to thee? will he speak soft words to thee?
\41:4\Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for ever?
\41:5\Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy maidens?
\41:6\Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among the merchants.
\41:7\Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears?
\41:8\Lay thy hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.
\41:9\Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the sight of him?
