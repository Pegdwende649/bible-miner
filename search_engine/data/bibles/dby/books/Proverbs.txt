Proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel:
to know wisdom and instruction; to discern the words of understanding;
to receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness and judgment, and equity;
to give prudence to the simple, to the young man knowledge and discretion.
He that is wise will hear, and will increase learning; and the intelligent will gain wise counsels:
to understand a proverb and an allegory, the words of the wise and their enigmas.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge: fools despise wisdom and instruction.
Hear, my son, the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;
for they shall be a garland of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
My son, if sinners entice thee, consent not.
If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk secretly for the innocent without cause;
let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, and whole, as those that go down into the pit;
we shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
cast in thy lot among us; we will all have one purse:
-- my son, walk not in the way with them, keep back thy foot from their path;
for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood.
For in vain the net is spread in the sight of anything which hath wings.
And these lay wait for their own blood; they lurk secretly for their own lives.
So are the paths of every one that is greedy of gain: it taketh away the life of its possessors.
Wisdom crieth without; she raiseth her voice in the broadways;
she calleth in the chief [place] of concourse, in the entry of the gates; in the city she uttereth her words:
How long, simple ones, will ye love simpleness, and scorners take pleasure in their scorning, and the foolish hate knowledge?
Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour forth my spirit unto you, I will make known to you my words.
Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no one regarded;
and ye have rejected all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
I also will laugh in your calamity, I will mock when your fear cometh;
when your fear cometh as sudden destruction, and your calamity cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish come upon you:
-- then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me early, and shall not find me.
Because they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of Jehovah;
they would none of my counsel, they despised all my reproof:
therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their way, and be filled with their own devices.
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of the foolish shall cause them to perish.
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be at rest from fear of evil.
My son, if thou receivest my words, and layest up my commandments with thee,
so that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom [and] thou apply thy heart to understanding;
yea, if thou criest after discernment [and] liftest up thy voice to understanding;
if thou seekest her as silver and searchest for her as for hidden treasures:
then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, and find the knowledge of God.
For Jehovah giveth wisdom; out of his mouth [come] knowledge and understanding.
He layeth up sound wisdom for the upright; [he] is a shield to them that walk in integrity;
guarding the paths of just judgment and keeping the way of his godly ones.
Then shalt thou understand righteousness and judgment and equity: every good path.
When wisdom entereth into thy heart and knowledge is pleasant unto thy soul,
discretion shall keep thee, understanding shall preserve thee:
To deliver thee from the way of evil, from the man that speaketh froward things;
[from those] who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
who rejoice to do evil, [and] delight in the frowardness of evil;
whose paths are crooked, and who are perverted in their course:
To deliver thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words;
who forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God;
-- for her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the dead;
none that go unto her return again, neither do they attain to the paths of life:
#NAME?
For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in it;
but the wicked shall be cut off from the land, and the unfaithful shall be plucked up out of it.
My son, forget not my teaching, and let thy heart observe my commandments;
for length of days, and years of life, and peace shall they add to thee.
Let not loving-kindness and truth forsake thee; bind them about thy neck, write them upon the tablet of thy heart:
and thou shalt find favour and good understanding in the sight of God and man.
Confide in Jehovah with all thy heart, and lean not unto thine own intelligence;
in all thy ways acknowledge him, and he will make plain thy paths.
Be not wise in thine own eyes; fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:
it shall be health for thy navel, and moisture for thy bones.
Honour Jehovah with thy substance, and with the first-fruits of all thine increase;
so shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy vats shall overflow with new wine.
My son, despise not the instruction of Jehovah, neither be weary of his chastisement;
for whom Jehovah loveth he chasteneth, even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
Blessed is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
For the gain thereof is better than the gain of silver, and her revenue than fine gold.
She is more precious than rubies; and all the things thou canst desire are not equal unto her.
Length of days is in her right hand; in her left hand riches and honour.
Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace.
She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her; and happy is he that retaineth her.
Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens.
By his knowledge the deeps were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.
My son, let them not depart from thine eyes; keep sound wisdom and discretion:
so shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace unto thy neck.
Then shalt thou walk in thy way securely, and thy foot shall not stumble;
when thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid, but thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be sweet.
Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the destruction of the wicked, when it cometh;
for Jehovah shall be thy confidence, and he will keep thy foot from being taken.
Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thy hand to do it.
Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to-morrow I will give, when thou hast it by thee.
Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
Envy not the man of violence, and choose none of his ways.
For the perverse is an abomination to Jehovah; but his secret is with the upright.
The curse of Jehovah is in the house of the wicked; but he blesseth the habitation of the righteous.
He indeed scorneth the scorners; but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
The wise shall inherit glory; but shame shall be the promotion of the foolish.
Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know intelligence;
for I give you good doctrine: forsake ye not my law.
For I was a son unto my father, tender and an only one in the sight of my mother.
And he taught me, and said unto me, Let thy heart retain my words; keep my commandments and live.
Get wisdom, get intelligence: forget [it] not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
Forsake her not, and she shall keep thee; love her, and she shall preserve thee.
The beginning of wisdom [is], Get wisdom; and with all thy getting get intelligence.
Exalt her, and she shall promote thee; she shall bring thee to honour when thou dost embrace her.
She shall give to thy head a garland of grace; a crown of glory will she bestow upon thee.
Hear, my son, and receive my sayings, and the years of thy life shall be multiplied.
I will teach thee in the way of wisdom, I will lead thee in paths of uprightness.
When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
Take fast hold of instruction, let [her] not go: keep her, for she is thy life.
Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil [men]:
avoid it, pass not by it; turn from it, and pass away.
For they sleep not except they have done mischief, and their sleep is taken away unless they have caused [some] to fall.
For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
But the path of the righteous is as the shining light, going on and brightening until the day be fully come.
The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thy heart.
For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
Keep thy heart more than anything that is guarded; for out of it are the issues of life.
Put away from thee perverseness of mouth, and corrupt lips put far from thee.
Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be well-ordered.
Turn not to the right hand nor to the left; remove thy foot from evil.
My son, attend unto my wisdom, incline thine ear to my understanding;
that thou mayest keep reflection, and that thy lips may preserve knowledge.
For the lips of the strange woman drop honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil;
but her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.
Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on Sheol.
Lest she should ponder the path of life, her ways wander, she knoweth not [whither].
And now, children, hearken unto me, and depart not from the words of my mouth.
Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel;
lest strangers be filled with thy wealth, and the fruits of thy toil [come] into the house of a stranger;
and thou mourn in thine end, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed;
and thou say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof!
and I have not hearkened unto the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to those that instructed me;
I was well nigh in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
Thy fountains shall be poured forth, as water-brooks in the broadways.
Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
Let thy fountain be blessed; and have joy of the wife of thy youth.
As a lovely hind and a graceful roe, let her breasts satisfy thee at all times: be thou ravished continually with her love.
And why shouldest thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger?
For the ways of man are before the eyes of Jehovah, and he pondereth all his paths.
His own iniquities shall take the wicked, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sin.
He shall die for want of discipline; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
My son, if thou hast become surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand for a stranger,
thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, since thou hast come into the hand of thy friend: go, humble thyself, and be urgent with thy friend.
Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids:
deliver thyself as a gazelle from the hand [of the hunter], and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways and be wise:
which having no chief, overseer, or ruler,
provideth her bread in the summer, [and] gathereth her food in the harvest.
How long, sluggard, wilt thou lie down? When wilt thou arise out of thy sleep?
A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest!
So shall thy poverty come as a roving plunderer, and thy penury as an armed man.
A man of Belial, a wicked person, is he that goeth about with a perverse mouth;
he winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
deceits are in his heart; he deviseth mischief at all times, he soweth discords.
Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly: in a moment shall he be broken, and without remedy.
These six [things] doth Jehovah hate, yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood;
a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations; feet that are swift in running to mischief;
a false witness that uttereth lies, and he that soweth discords among brethren.
My son, observe thy father's commandment, and forsake not the teaching of thy mother;
bind them continually upon thy heart, tie them about thy neck:
when thou walkest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and [when] thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
For the commandment is a lamp, and the teaching a light, and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
to keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
Lust not after her beauty in thy heart, neither let her take thee with her eyelids;
for by means of a whorish woman [a man is brought] to a loaf of bread, and another's wife doth hunt for the precious soul.
Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his garments not be burned?
Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be scorched?
So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife: whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
They do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry:
and if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
Whoso committeth adultery with a woman is void of understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.
A wound and contempt shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
For jealousy is the rage of a man, and he will not spare in the day of vengeance;
he will not regard any ransom, neither will he rest content though thou multipliest [thy] gifts.
My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
Keep my commandments, and live; and my teaching, as the apple of thine eye.
Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the tablet of thy heart.
Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister, and call intelligence [thy] kinswoman:
that they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger who flattereth with her words.
For at the window of my house, I looked forth through my lattice,
and I beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the sons, a young man void of understanding,
passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
in the twilight, in the evening of the day, in the blackness of night and the darkness.
And behold, there met him a woman in the attire of a harlot, and subtle of heart.
She is clamorous and unmanageable; her feet abide not in her house:
now without, now in the broadways, -- and she lieth in wait at every corner.
And she caught him and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,
I have peace-offerings with me; this day have I paid my vows:
therefore came I forth to meet thee, to seek earnestly thy face, and I have found thee.
I have decked my bed with tapestry coverlets of variegated linen from Egypt;
I have perfumed my couch with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
Come, let us revel in love until the morning, let us delight ourselves with loves.
For the husband is not at home, he is gone a long journey;
he hath taken the money-bag with him, he will come home on the day of the full moon.
With her much enticement she beguiled him; with the smoothness of her lips she constrained him.
He went after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, and as stocks [serve] for the correction of the fool;
till an arrow strike through his liver: as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for its life.
And now, ye sons, hearken unto me, and attend to the words of my mouth.
Let not thy heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths:
for she hath cast down many wounded, and all slain by her were strong.
Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death.
Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding give forth her voice?
On the top of high places by the way, at the cross-paths she taketh her stand.
Beside the gates, at the entry of the city, at the coming in at the doors, she crieth aloud.
Unto you, men, I call, and my voice is to the sons of man:
O ye simple, understand prudence; and ye foolish, understand sense.
Hear, for I will speak excellent things, and the opening of my lips shall be right things.
For my palate shall meditate truth, and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing tortuous or perverse in them.
They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold:
for wisdom is better than rubies, and all the things that may be desired are not equal to it.
I wisdom dwell [with] prudence, and find the knowledge [which cometh] of reflection.
The fear of Jehovah is to hate evil; pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth do I hate.
Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am intelligence; I have strength.
By me kings reign, and rulers make just decrees;
by me princes rule, and nobles, all the judges of the earth.
I love those that love me; and they that seek me early shall find me.
Riches and honour are with me; durable wealth and righteousness.
My fruit is better than fine gold, yea, than pure gold; and my revenue than choice silver.
I walk in the path of righteousness, in the midst of the paths of judgment:
that I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasuries.
Jehovah possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
I was set up from eternity, from the beginning, before the earth was.
When there were no depths, I was brought forth, when there were no fountains abounding with water.
Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth;
while as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the beginning of the dust of the world.
When he prepared the heavens I was there; when he ordained the circle upon the face of the deep;
when he established the skies above, when the fountains of the deep became strong;
when he imposed on the sea his decree that the waters should not pass his commandment, when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
then I was by him [his] nursling, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth, and my delights [were] with the sons of men.
And now, sons, hearken unto me, and blessed are they that keep my ways:
hear instruction and be wise, and refuse it not.
Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
For whoso findeth me findeth life, and obtaineth favour of Jehovah;
but he that sinneth against me doeth violence to his own soul: all they that hate me love death.
Wisdom hath built her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars;
she hath slaughtered her cattle, she hath mingled her wine, she hath also prepared her table;
she hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the summits of the high places of the city,
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither. To him that is void of understanding, she saith,
Come, eat ye of my bread, and drink of the wine that I have mingled.
Forsake follies and live, and go in the way of intelligence.
He that instructeth a scorner getteth to himself shame; and he that reproveth a wicked [man] [getteth] to himself a blot.
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee; reprove a wise [man], and he will love thee.
Impart to a wise [man], and he will become yet wiser; teach a righteous [man], and he will increase learning.
The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of wisdom; and the knowledge of the Holy is intelligence.
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and years of life shall be added to thee.
If thou art wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself; and if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
The foolish woman is clamorous; she is stupid, and knoweth nothing.
And she sitteth at the entry of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
to call passers-by who go right on their ways:
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither. And to him that is void of understanding she saith,
Stolen waters are sweet, and the bread of secrecy is pleasant.
But he knoweth not that the dead are there; [that] her guests are in the depths of Sheol.
