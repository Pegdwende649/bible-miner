&gt; I was glad when they said to me, "Let's go to Yahweh's house!"
Our feet are standing within your gates, Jerusalem;
Jerusalem, that is built as a city that is compact together;
Where the tribes go up, even Yah's tribes, According to an ordinance for Israel, To give thanks to the name of Yahweh.
For there are set thrones for judgment, The thrones of David's house.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. Those who love you will prosper.
Peace be within your walls, And prosperity within your palaces.
For my brothers' and companions' sakes, I will now say, "Peace be within you."
For the sake of the house of Yahweh our God, I will seek your good.
